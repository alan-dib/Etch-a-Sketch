<img src="./images/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Alt text for accessibility" width="600">


## Overview 

A browser-based recreation of the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy. This project allows users to draw pixelated art by hovering over a grid with their mouse, simulating the knob-controlled drawing experience. Built as part of The Odin Project Foundation course, it demonstrates core web development skills like DOM manipulation, event handling and CSS flexbox layout.

## Features

**Grid drawing**: 16x16 grid (default) where hovering changes cell colors to leave a trail.

**Resize functionality**: Resize the grid up to 100 x 100.

**Color modes** <br>
• Classic black-and-white mode. <br>
• Random RGB mode <br>
• Progressive darkening effect

**Clear button**: Resets grid back to 60x60 to start fresh.


## Installation 

1. Clone this repo 
2. Open index.html in your browser 
3. DONE!

## How to use <br>

• Load the page to see default 16x16 grid <br>
• Hover your mouse over the cells to draw <br>
• Enter a valid number to resize the grid between 16x16 and 100x100 <br>
• Use clear button to restart your drawing <br>
• Switch modes by pressing the buttons 

## Technologies used

• HTML5: Structure the grid container and UI elements <br>
• CSS3: Flexbox layout for the drawing board; hover effects and styling <br>
• JAVASCRIPT: Dynamic grid generation and event listeners for mouse interactions

## Learning outcomes

**This project helped solidify:** <br>

• Creating and manipulation DOM elements <br>
• Handling user input and events (e.g., mouseover) <br>
• CSS Flexbox <br>
• Basic algorithm for grid resizing and color manipulation

## Potentital improvements  <br>
 
• Add touch/Drag support for mobile devices <br>
• Implement save/export functionality (e.g., download as PNG).
