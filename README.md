<img src="./images/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Alt text for accessibility" width="600">


## Overview 

A browser-based recreation of the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy. This project allows users to draw pixelated art by hovering over a grid with their mouse, simulating the knob-controlled drawing experience. Built as part of The Odin Project Foundation course, it demonstrates core web development skills like DOM manipulation, event handling and CSS flexbox layout.

## Features

**Grid drawing**: 16x16 grid (default) where hovering changes cell colors to leave a trail.

**Resize functionality**: Resize the grid up to 100 x 100.

**Color modes**: 
• Classic black-and-white mode.
• Random RGB mode 
• Progressive darkening effect

**Clear button**: Resets grid back to 60x60 to start fresh.


## Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. Open index.html in your browser
3. DONE!

## How to use

•  Load the page to see default 16x16 grid
•  Hover your mouse over the cells to draw
•  Enter a valid number to resize the grid between 16x16 and 100x100
•  Use clear button to restart your drawing
•  Switch modes by pressing the buttons 

## Technologies used

• HTML5: Structure the grid container and UI elements
• CSS3: Flexbox layout for the drawing board; hover effects and styling
• JAVASCRIPT: Dynamic grid generation and event listeners for mouse interactions

## Learning outcomes

**This project helped solidify:**

•  Creating and manipulation DOM elements
•  Handling user input and events (e.g., mouseover)
•  CSS Flexbox
•  Basic algorithm for grid resizing and color manipulation

## Potentital improvements 

• Add touch/Drag support for mobile devices
• Implement save/export functionality (e.g., download as PNG).
